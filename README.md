# csc202-assignment2.1
In this assignment, you will work with conditionals, functions, and event-driven programming.

Guidelines
At a minimum, you need to include 2 conditional statement blocks (i.e., 2 separate if/else statements), 2 functions, and 2 buttons that each call one of the functions you wrote. You can pick the theme of your choice, or you can use a theme of a catapult launch. For the catapult launch, an object of your choice should be launched towards a target when a button is clicked, and a random number should be generated to represent the distance of the launch. If statements should determine if the target was hit, and if not how much did it miss by. The second button should select a new target. 

Expectations
Include a minimum of 2 conditional statement blocks.
Write and call at least 2 functions.
Create at least 2 buttons.
Over-comment the code to show your understanding of the code and the intent of your application.
Name your controls using best naming practices.
Your application must have a great UX and provide the user with more than enough information they will need to use your application without help.
Deliverables / Submission 
Video of your work demonstrating all functionality of this assignment.
Submit the zipped project folders and files and include the solution to GitHub.
Projects that significantly exceed the requirements will need prior approval from the instructor and may require a code review to receive credit.
